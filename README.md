# CS440_CH04_Demo_Corona_Joshua

  I chose the Apache 2.0 liscence for this repository. I chose this liscence because I believe sharing of information and innovation can lead to better products for everyone. It also helps new developers understand devloping techniques and allows them to get started on their own projects at a faster pace. I chose Apache beacause even though its free to use and modify, it must include the original copywerigt in its implementation. Credit should be given where its deserved, while aloowing others to build of a very good idea.
